# Parallel Sorting Using C and MPICH

This repo contains implementations of various parallel sorting algorithms using the MPI standard (MPICH library). Each algorithm is timed for sorting 10,000,000 random numbers, and prints the time taken for each processor - distinguishing between communication time and computation time.
